## Kommasetzung by Till NÃ¶llgen

With this little program we try to predict at which positions in any kind of german text there is a comma. For this we use a LSTM network that we train with random free available german books online (Hoping that they properly use the comma rules). For better readablility I wrote the program in a jupyter notebook, because it lets me combine text and code in the same sheet as well print out preliminary statuses. The project was inspired from previouse code from Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree and variouse scientific papers about sentiment analysis and word2vec - research (linked in the jupyter notebook). To see the program open the jupyter notebook file "KOMMASETZUNG PREVERSION.ipynb".
